# Codacy quality gate

The repo is wired with a **Codacy pre-push gate**: before a `git push` completes,
the official [Codacy MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codacy/codacy-mcp)
runs a local analysis (in-process `@codacy/analysis-runner`, no Docker needed)
on the repository, and the push is **blocked** when any changed file carries an
error-level (critical/major) finding.

## How it works

- `scripts/hooks/pre-push` — the git hook (wired via `git config core.hooksPath
  scripts/hooks`). Collects the files being pushed, filters to code files, and
  invokes the gate.
- `scripts/codacy/pre-push-gate.mjs` — spawns the MCP server over stdio, calls
  `codacy_cli_analyze(rootPath=<repo>)`, filters results to changed files with
  `level === "error"`, and exits 1 (block) or 0 (allow).

The gate **degrades to allow** (with a warning) when the MCP server is missing
or analysis tooling fails — a broken tool must never brick pushes.

## Setup (one-time, per machine)

```bash
npm install -g @codacy/codacy-mcp          # the MCP server the gate spawns
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks    # activate the hooks in this clone
```

## Escape hatches

- `git push --no-verify` — standard git override.
- `CODACY_GATE_OFF=1 git push` — environment override.

## First run

The first analysis auto-initializes the repo (`codacy-cli init` equivalent:
writes `.codacy/codacy.config.json` + baseline and downloads tool runtimes into
`~/.codacy/runtimes`) — allow a few minutes. Subsequent runs use the cached
runtimes.

## Agent workflow

Agents should also run the analysis **before finishing work**, not just at push
time. In the kernel:

```python
import codacy
await codacy.list_tools()                       # discover tools
await codacy.codacy_cli_analyze(rootPath=".")   # local analysis (no token needed)
```

Cloud tools (repo issues, security findings, PR analysis) need a token in
`~/.prime/agent/codacy/server.env` (`CODACY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, from
https://app.codacy.com/account/access-management). The repo key on Codacy would
be `gh/Bonobo791/the-lippincott-team` (from the git remote).
