# Agent Guidance

- NEVER develop on the default branch. ONLY work on the dev branch unless explicitly authorized to work on another branch.
- When I say "clean up", that means to clean your worktrees and branches.
- When I say "triage", review every PR comment for validity. Fix each valid issue. Post a triage comment. Reply to every bot comment, whether or not you make a code change.
- NEVER push to the branch. Only commit and add a commit message.

## Project overview

**TinaCMS + Astro starter site** (`lippincott-team-astro-tina`) hosted on Netlify (also deployable on
Coolify/Docker): content is edited visually in the TinaCMS admin and shipped as static HTML. The site
ships **zero React** to browsers — React is a pinned devDependency for building the Tina admin UI (see
`README.md` "A note on React"; do not remove it casually), while `tinacms` is a runtime dependency
because the `/tina-island` endpoint's generated client imports `tinacms/dist/client` in the standalone
server bundle.

- Astro **7** (`output: 'static'`), Tailwind CSS **v4** (`@tailwindcss/vite`), TypeScript strict.
- Content (Markdown/MDX + JSON) lives in `src/content/` (`blog/*.mdx`, `page/*.mdx`, `team/*.mdx`,
  `community/**/*.mdx` nested hierarchies, `config/config.json`) and is queried through the generated
  client in `tina/__generated__/` — not Astro's content layer (`src/content.config.ts` only silences a
  warning).
- Visual editing: `@tinacms/astro` vanilla-JS bridge + one on-demand endpoint (`/tina-island/[name]`)
  that re-renders editable regions; everything else prerenders to static HTML.
- Package manager: **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`). Node **>= 22.22.0**
  (`.nvmrc`).
- Root `pyproject.toml` (no dependencies) backs the `.venv/` used by tooling scripts; the site has no
  Python code.

## Agent skills

Project-level agent skills live in `.agents/skills/` — consult before working in these areas:

- `astro` — Astro structure, CLI, config, adapters. Prefer examples from <https://docs.astro.build> for
  the latest API.
- `tinacms` — schema (`tina/config.ts`), collections, visual editing, common errors (build ordering,
  field naming, path mismatches); see its `references/` for troubleshooting.
- `netlify-*` — official Netlify skills (`netlify-deploy`, `netlify-config`, `netlify-functions`,
  `netlify-edge-functions`, `netlify-frameworks`) for deployment/configuration work.
- `visual-loop` — iterative visual QA: edit code, screenshot with Playwright
  (`scripts/audit/shoot.mjs` / `probe-styles.mjs`), view the PNGs, compare to spec/baseline, re-shoot
  until clean. Use for any frontend change that must be verified visually. Non-rendering changes (build
  scripts, backend logic, tooling, docs) skip the screenshot loop — a green `pnpm build:local` suffices.

## Build and dev commands

From `package.json`:

- `pnpm dev` — `tinacms dev -c "astro dev"`; site at `localhost:4321`, visual editor at `/admin/`.
- `pnpm build` — `tinacms build --content=local -c "NODE_ENV=production astro build"`. Compiles against
  TinaCloud; **fails fast with `ERR_MISSING_CLOUD_CREDS` without `PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` and
  `TINA_TOKEN`** (get them at app.tina.io).
- `pnpm build:local` — fully local/offline, no TinaCloud auth. `pnpm build:search` — `tinacms
  search-index`. `pnpm preview` — `astro preview`.

The build scripts prefix `NODE_ENV=production` on purpose: the tinacms CLI bundles its config via Vite
in-process, and Vite defaults `NODE_ENV` to `development` when unset — without the prefix it leaks into
`astro build`, flips `import.meta.env.PROD` to false, and silently drops the production-only GA4 snippet
(see Analytics under Deployment).

**Build order matters**: `tinacms build` must run before `astro build` so `tina/__generated__/` exists.
Always use the scripts above, never bare `astro build`.

The generated client reads content from a **seeded cache** (`tina/__generated__/.cache/<timestamp>`)
written by the last Tina build — plain `npx astro dev` keeps serving that snapshot, so after editing
content files outside the Tina admin rerun `pnpm build:local` and restart the dev server, or changes
(new frontmatter fields, removed URLs) won't show up. Related caveat: bare `astro dev` only serves
content when `tina/__generated__/client.ts` points at TinaCloud — `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build:local` both
pin it to `localhost:4001`, so after either, run a credentialed `pnpm build` (or use `pnpm dev`) before
dev-server iteration.

## Code organization

- `tina/config.ts` — TinaCMS config (branch detection from host env vars, admin built to
  `public/admin`, media in `public/`).
- `tina/collections/` — collections: `blog.ts`, `page.ts`, `global-config.ts`, `team.ts`,
  `community.ts`; the page collection's block list imports per-block template schemas.
- `tina/__generated__/` — generated client/types; regenerate via the dev/build scripts after any schema
  change; never hand-edit. In the pinned tinacms version `tina/tina-lock.json` is only written by
  `tinacms dev` — after a schema change run `pnpm dev` once (then stop it) to regenerate the lock.
- `src/lib/data.ts` — per-collection data loaders plus **all** content types. Types are pure derivations
  from the Tina schema (loader return types / `Extract` on `PageBlock`) — never hand-write content
  shapes; the collection is the source of truth.
- `src/lib/islands.ts` — island registry mapping `/tina-island/<name>` slugs to fetcher + component +
  wrapper. A new editable region = one entry here; `src/pages/tina-island/[name].ts` picks it up
  automatically.
- `src/components/blocks/` — the page-builder blocks. Page collection only: Hero, CTA, Features, Stats,
  Testimonial, Callout, Content, Split, Video, Faq, TeamGrid, CommunityGrid, TrustStrip,
  TestimonialShowcase, Awards, TeamBanner, ContactForm. Community page blocks (registered in **both**
  collections): GuideHero, StatLedger, PriceLadder, CalloutRail, DataTable, PhotoCardGrid,
  CategoryTiles, RouteLedger, TradeOffs, NotePanel, ProofStage, RelatedChips, GuideCta, ChecklistSplit,
  StepsSplit.
  **Convention: each block is a pair** — `<Name>.astro` (rendering) + `<name>.template.ts` (Tina
  `Template` schema); multi-word blocks use camelCase template filenames (`teamGrid.template.ts` —
  snake_case generates mismatched GraphQL typenames). Register new templates in
  `tina/collections/page.ts` (always) and `community.ts` (when available on community pages); `page.ts`
  registers everything, `community.ts` the 7 legacy templates (hero, split, features, stats, content,
  faq, cta) plus the 15 community blocks. Tina namespaces block typenames per collection+field
  (`PageBlocksHero` vs `CommunityBlocksHero`), and `Blocks.astro` dispatches on the suffix after
  stripping the `Page|CommunityBlocks` prefix. **Watch field-name collisions across the block union**:
  two templates in the same `blocks` field may not reuse a field name with a different value type
  (`body` rich-text JSON vs string, `image` object vs image string) — **nullability counts too**
  (`String` vs `String!` from `required: true`) — codegen fails with "Fields ... conflict". Pick a
  distinct name (`summary`, `description`, `backgroundImage`) instead.
- **Every community/school page is block-driven** (Cypress order: guideHero → market statLedger →
  priceLadder → schools calloutRail/dataTable → photoCardGrid → categoryTiles → routeLedger →
  cost-of-living statLedger → tradeOffs → comparison dataTable → proofStage → faq → relatedChips →
  guideCta; sections drop out when no sourced data exists). The legacy frontmatter-hero +
  rich-text-body path in `CommunityBody.astro` is only a fallback for docs without blocks. Market
  figures were researched per community (Realtor.com local-market pages, U.S. News, district sites —
  June 2026) and every stat carries a `source` citation; when updating numbers, cite the same way and
  never copy one community's figures into another's.
- `src/components/islands/` — `PageBody`/`BlogBody`/`CommunityBody` island wrappers;
  `src/components/ui/` — reusable UI (incl. `FaqAccordion.astro`); `src/components/mdx/` — MDX
  components.
- `src/pages/` — routes: `index.astro` (**static one-off homepage**, not Tina-block-driven; own scoped
  palette/typography — fonts per the tokens bullet below — inside the shared `Base` chrome; `home.mdx`
  stays in Tina unrendered), `buy.astro` / `sell.astro` / `reviews.astro` (**static one-off pages** in
  the same "Verified Record" design world per `DESIGN.md` — not Tina-editable; all share
  `src/styles/v2.css`, extracted verbatim from index.astro, and the reveal/count-up script
  `src/components/v2/V2Motion.astro`; buy/sell each carry their own FAQPage JSON-LD; `reviews.mdx` stays
  in Tina unrendered), `[...slug].astro` (pages), `about/[...slug].astro` (team bios),
  `northwest-houston-real-estate/[...slug].astro` and `northwest-houston-schools-real-estate/[...slug].astro`
  (community/school hierarchies), `blog/`, `rss.xml.ts`, `404.astro`, `tina-island/[name].ts`.
  The reviews live feed is the HAR.com native script widget
  (`https://members.har.com/realtor-agent-rating/api/default.cfm`), which returns rendered ratings and
  comments for a `<script src>` embed. It uses legacy `document.writeln`, so links to `/reviews/` carry
  `data-astro-reload` (full document load instead of ClientRouter navigation); card chrome lives on
  `.har-widget` in `v2.css`, and `.feed-note` links to the full survey history on HAR.com.
  `shoot.mjs`/`probe-styles.mjs` hit the native endpoint directly.
- `src/styles/global.css` — Tailwind v4 entry (`@import 'tailwindcss'`, theme tokens).
- `scripts/migrate/` — one-off WordPress→Tina migration pipeline, kept for provenance. `data/` (cached
  WP API responses) is gitignored; run with `node scripts/migrate/<name>.mjs`.
- `scripts/audit/` — Playwright design-fidelity tooling for the `visual-loop` skill: `shoot.mjs`
  (screenshots: 10 templates × 3 viewports + interaction shots + error manifest) and `probe-styles.mjs`
  (computed-style extraction for numeric spec comparison). Run `node scripts/audit/<name>.mjs --base
  <url> --out <dir>`; output goes to the gitignored `.launch/qa/`. Interactive browsing: `npx playwright
  cli --browser=chromium` (no system Chrome installed).
- `scripts/` + `.github/workflows/bunny-purge.yml` — Bunny CDN purge tooling (`bunny-purge.mjs`,
  `bunny-url.mjs`, `deploy/docker-entrypoint.sh`, `deploy/write-commit-marker.mjs`, the CI workflow);
  roles and flow under "CDN (Bunny)" in Deployment.

## Key conventions

- **Community pages are NOT "guides".** The pages under `/northwest-houston-real-estate/` and
  `/northwest-houston-schools-real-estate/` are **community pages**; "guides" are the downloadable
  documents linked from them (`/uploads/2026/08/guide-to-waller.pdf`, `guide-to-tomball.pdf`,
  `guide-to-cypress.docx`). Never mix the terms. Block names (`GuideHero`, `GuideCta`, etc.) are legacy
  identifiers and stay unchanged.
- **Copy style: research/marketing voice, not chat-room phrasing.** Never "Bottom Line" as a heading or
  summary marker (use "The Takeaway" or a plain paragraph), never "not a guess"-style filler ("not an
  algorithm", "no guess"), no conversational interjections in published copy. The voice is direct and
  data-backed.
- Tina field names: **letters, numbers, and underscores only (no hyphens)**.
- The `/about/` roster (`teamGrid` block) shows only team docs with `featured: true`, ordered by `order`
  (lowest first; the first member renders as the large lead cell). Bio pages under `/about/<slug>/`
  render all team docs regardless of `featured`.
- Agent bio pages (`TeamBody.astro`): breadcrumb + H1, portrait/bio split, contact ledger, ink proof
  band, team chips, personalized CTA, `ProfilePage` JSON-LD. Optional team fields: `headline` overrides
  the H1 (`**…**` marks the italic accent; falls back to the two-tone name split), `location` sets the
  home market ("Based in" ledger cell + JSON-LD `workLocation`; defaults to Northwest Houston, TX),
  `marketLogo` renders a market-specific team mark (e.g. Lippincott Team Dallas/Abilene) under the bio.
  The proof band reuses the `ProofStage` block with hardcoded team-wide metrics; the chips row
  self-fetches teammates via `listTeam()` (featured first, current agent excluded).
- Blog: posts carry a `category` select (Communities, Buying, Selling, Pricing, Financing, Market,
  Relocating, Living) shown as the kicker on index and article pages. The article template
  (`BlogBody.astro`) renders breadcrumb, byline meta row (author comes from the `amy-lippincott-2` team
  doc — the schema has no author field), a "The short answer" capsule from `description`, a sticky "On
  this page" TOC and reading time from the body (`src/lib/article.ts` — `extractToc`,
  `readingTimeMinutes`; h2 anchors come from the `ArticleH2` TinaMarkdown override, whose slug algorithm
  must stay in sync with `extractToc`), an inline CTA panel, author box, and category-first related
  reads.
- The `contactForm` block renders the entire contact page (SplitHeading H1 from `heading`, the
  `/api/contact` form — host-neutral, forwards leads to Sierra on every platform, replacing the old
  Netlify Forms + `netlify/functions/contact-sierra.ts` flow — config-driven contact rail, reassurance
  strip); `contact-us.mdx` is that single block. See `src/pages/api/contact.ts` +
  `src/lib/sierra-contact.ts`.
- Rich-text bodies render through `<TinaMarkdown>` from `@tinacms/astro`. Never test a rich-text field
  with plain truthiness (`data.note && ...`) — Tina returns an empty root-node **object** for unset
  fields, which is truthy and renders phantom containers with margins. Use `hasRichText(field)` from
  `src/lib/rich-text.ts`.
- Section vertical rhythm: transparent-surface blocks `py-12 md:py-16`; background/dark bands
  `py-16 md:py-24` (stacked sections sum both paddings).
- The `faq` block's optional `jsonld` boolean makes `Faq.astro` emit a `FAQPage` schema.org script from
  the block's Q&A items (answers flattened via `richTextToPlainText` in `src/lib/rich-text.ts`). Enable
  on at most one FAQ block per page.
- The `dataTable` block's optional `anchorId` sets the section's HTML `id` for jump links (e.g.
  `#communities`).
- Page docs carry `seoTitle` plus an optional `description`; `[...slug].astro` falls back to
  `config.seo.description` when the per-page field is empty.
- Split headings: editors mark the accented phrase with `**...**` in plain Tina string fields (the
  brand's light+bold heading device). Render with `src/components/ui/SplitHeading.astro` (parser in
  `src/lib/split-heading.ts`); accent styling comes from its `accentClass` prop.
- Fonts and tokens — the design language is "The Verified Record" (system.css spec): **Fraunces
  Variable** (300/400) carries display, **Inter Variable** carries body/function; `--font-sans` is
  Inter, `--font-heading`/`--font-serif` are Fraunces (italic axis imported). Base `h1–h4` weight is 400
  (Fraunces 600 reads heavy). Theme tokens live in the `@theme` block of `src/styles/global.css`,
  `:root` values: `--primary: #d6323c` (red), `--secondary`/`--foreground`/`--ink`/`--tile: #17151a`
  (ink), `--body: #3c3a41`, `--section`/`--muted`/`--accent: #f6f2ea` (ivory), `--gold: #c9a15a`,
  `--stat-label: #7a7780`, `--hairline: #e7e2d6`, `--border`/`--input: #e8e3d9`, `--radius: 1rem`.
  Eyebrows on dark surfaces are gold (`.eyebrow.on-dark`), not red.
- Hero block: `variant` — `simple`/`photo`/`glass`/`video` — plus `backgroundImage`, `backgroundVideo`
  (optional MP4 URL), and `eyebrow` (renders on photo/glass/video). `video` is the Apple-style
  full-viewport hero: bottom-left content, gradient scrim, drifting light beams, masked-line headline
  reveal (editors split the reveal lines with a line break in the headline); without `backgroundVideo`
  it renders `backgroundImage` as a full-bleed still. Homepage videos are self-hosted in
  `public/uploads/` behind the Netlify CDN — re-encode to web-friendly H.264 (`libx264` CRF 24–28, AAC
  96k, `+faststart`) before committing and keep every file well under GitHub's 100 MB limit (current
  set: 8–30 MB from 35–468 MB originals); posters are webp. Larger future videos (e.g. hero loops) go to
  Cloudflare R2 behind the CDN, not the repo.
- GuideHero (community pages): the "stage" hero — a `min-h-[72svh]` ink band with optional
  `backgroundImage` (full-bleed + gradient scrim; without it, a solid dark band), bottom-left content:
  gold `eyebrow on-dark`, Fraunces-light H1 with gold italic accent, ghost chips (`border-white/30
  bg-white/10`), optional `actions` (red button / white text link, same shape as GuideCta's).
- Apple-style homepage blocks (all render in the `.font-apple` system/Inter stack with italic `**...**`
  accents via `SplitHeading`): `TrustStrip` (flat parchment trust bar — plain title segments = small
  label, accented = big figure), `Stats` (near-black `--tile` count-up), `TestimonialShowcase` (video +
  dark quote-panel carousel), `Awards` (sticky intro + numbered list), `TeamBanner` (crimson-gradient
  photo banner). Chrome: a 72px `rgba(23,21,26,.82)` blur `Header.astro` with an ivory hairline bottom
  border, and a dark `#100e13` `Footer.astro`. The mobile menu is a dark dropdown panel under the header
  bar (not a full-screen overlay). Desktop nav appears at `min-[1320px]` (the 9 config links + phone +
  CTA measurably overflow below that; link gaps stay 16px — the spec's 26px gaps plus the phone link no
  longer fit the 1440px container, so only the phone joins at `min-[1440px]`). The header CTA uses the
  spec's translateY/shadow hover, not `.btn-magnetic` (whose rAF transform would override it).
- Motion: `gsap` (npm dep, bundled via Astro `<script>` imports — never CDN) drives the CommunityGrid
  `rail` variant's pinned horizontal pan and the TestimonialShowcase clip-path reveal. Count-up stats,
  `.h2-mask` headline reveals and magnetic `.btn-magnetic` CTAs are vanilla JS (shared inline script in
  `src/layouts/Base.astro`). Everything must no-op under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Block variants: Cta `default` (light) / `crimson` (solid red, beams, contact row from
  `config.contact`); CommunityGrid `grid` / `rail`; Features `cards` (default) / `editorial`
  (borderless, ~70×3px red top-rule above each title, `md:grid-cols-2`, no icon tile, spec pattern #12)
  / `services` (ink top-rule, crimson icon, arrow link). Features items may add an `action`
  (`label`+`link`) rendering a full-width red Button pinned to the card bottom; external http(s) links
  open in a new tab. Shared Apple tokens live in `src/styles/global.css`: `--tile`, `--gold`,
  `--accent-on-dark`, `--ink`, `--hairline`. The Split block's optional `eyebrow` renders the red
  uppercase chip (Hero-glass styling) above the title.
- Prose tables (rich-text bodies): hairline `var(--border)` borders, padded cells, bold red first
  column — styled globally under `.prose` in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Sticky mobile click-to-call bar: a pure-CSS fixed bottom bar in `src/layouts/Base.astro` (`lg:hidden`,
  `bg-primary`, phone from `config.contact.phone` as a `tel:` link, no JS). A `h-14 lg:hidden` spacer
  after the footer keeps it from covering footer content; it sits at `z-10`, below the sticky header
  (`z-20`) so the open mobile menu paints over it.
- CommunityGrid cards (and `CommunityBody`) link to the community's Sierra property-search URL
  (external, new tab) when one exists — the `sierraLinks` map in `src/lib/sierra-links.ts` holds the
  URLs recovered from the migrated community bodies; communities without one fall back to their internal
  community page.
- `compressHTML: true` in `astro.config.mjs` is deliberate (pins Astro 6 whitespace behavior) — see the
  inline comment before changing it.

## Testing and quality checks

**Codacy pre-push gate**: `scripts/hooks/pre-push` (activated via `git config core.hooksPath
scripts/hooks`; see `scripts/codacy/README.md`) runs `scripts/codacy/pre-push-gate.mjs` before any
`git push` — Codacy local analysis (official `@codacy/codacy-mcp` over stdio) — and blocks the push when
a changed file carries error-level (critical/major) findings. Escape hatches: `git push --no-verify` or
`CODACY_GATE_OFF=1`. Agents should also run the analysis when finishing work — `import codacy; await
codacy.codacy_cli_analyze(rootPath=".")` (kernel skill; local analysis needs no token, cloud tools need
`CODACY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` in `~/.prime/agent/codacy/server.env`). Tokenless local analysis rewrites
`.codacy/codacy.config.json` (committed, remote-sourced) — the gate restores it, but after manual runs
do `git checkout -- .codacy/` unless you intend to update the config.

There is **no test suite, linter, or formatter configured**. Validate changes with:

- `pnpm build:local` (or `pnpm build` with TinaCloud credentials) — the Tina codegen + Astro build is
  the de-facto check; fix any type/schema errors.
- `npx astro check` (`@astrojs/check`) for type-checking `.astro` files.
- Visual iteration: `npx astro dev --port 4322` (not `pnpm dev`) + screenshots — component/CSS edits
  hot-reload in under a second; the separate port keeps a `pnpm preview` server on 4321. Reserve
  `NODE_ENV=production pnpm build:local` + `pnpm preview` for per-task gates, Tina schema changes,
  production-only behavior (`compressHTML`, GA4 gating, island endpoints), and final evidence shots. See
  the `visual-loop` skill for the full loop, and the seeded-cache/client-pointer caveats under "Build
  and dev commands" before iterating against bare `astro dev`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/tina-lock.yml` runs `pnpm build:local` on PRs to `main` and fails if
  `tina/tina-lock.json` is stale (a stale lock breaks the Netlify build's TinaCloud cloud check; see the
  `tina/__generated__/` note above for how to regenerate it).
- SonarQube MCP (pre-commit): `import sonarqube`;
  `get_project_quality_gate_status(projectKey="Bonobo791_lippincott-team-astro-tina")`; issues:
  `search_sonar_issues_in_projects(projectKeys=[...])`; local: `analyze_code_snippet(fileContent,
  language, projectKey)`. Creds: `~/.prime/agent/sonarqube/server.env`.

## Deployment

Host-neutral: `astro.config.mjs` auto-detects the adapter from platform env vars (Vercel, Cloudflare
Pages/Workers, Netlify) and falls back to a standalone Node server (`node ./dist/server/entry.mjs`).
Force one with `DEPLOY_ADAPTER=vercel|cloudflare|netlify|node`. `wrangler.jsonc` targets Cloudflare
Workers with `nodejs_compat` (required by the `/tina-island` route's `node:async_hooks`).

**Netlify**: `netlify.toml` pins the build command (`pnpm build`; TinaCloud credentials are configured
in the Netlify UI) and sets `SITE_URL = "https://thelippincottteam.com"` under
`[context.production.environment]` so deploy previews keep their Netlify-injected URL. The committed
`pnpm-lock.yaml` and the `packageManager` field are what make Netlify install with pnpm — do not
re-ignore the lockfile.

**Coolify / Docker**: the root multi-stage `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` build with `pnpm build`
(TinaCloud credentials required) and run the adapter-node standalone server. Coolify apps use the
**Dockerfile** build pack (`/Dockerfile`, the default). App env vars pass as build args by default
(Build Variable flag); the proxy injects `PORT`/`HOST` — keep **Ports Exposes** on `4321` to match
`EXPOSE`. Required env: `PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID`, `TINA_TOKEN`, `SITE_URL`. The Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK`
(node fetch on `/`) is parsed by Coolify, takes precedence over UI checks, and gates Traefik routing +
rolling updates. The container needs egress to TinaCloud (`content.tina.io` / `app.tina.io`) for content
and visual editing; stateless, no volumes. `CONTEXT` is unset there, so production builds include GA4.

**CDN (Bunny)**: a pull zone fronts the Coolify origin (set **Origin Host Header** to the app's domain —
Traefik routes by `Host`), plus a storage zone serving `/uploads/*` media via an edge rule with the
**Origin URL per request** action pointing at the storage zone's `*.b-cdn.net` hostname — media stays in
the repo, content paths never change. Cache rules (in order): bypass `*/api/*` + `*/tina-island/*`;
uploads → storage origin + 30 d; `*/_astro/*` → 1 y; `*/__moderaty_commit.txt*` → bypass; HTML `*/` →
10 min.

Deploys purge the pull zone **after the new code is serving**, exactly once, from CI.
`scripts/deploy/write-commit-marker.mjs` (prefixed onto the `build*` scripts) writes
`public/__moderaty_commit.txt` (gitignored) with the build's commit SHA (from `SOURCE_COMMIT` — Coolify
needs *Include Source Commit in Build* — `COMMIT_REF`, `GITHUB_SHA`, or git). On push to `main`,
`.github/workflows/bunny-purge.yml` polls the origin's marker until it returns the pushed SHA, then runs
`scripts/bunny-purge.mjs` (full zone, per-URL, or the CI `--wait-for-commit` mode; no-op without
credentials, fails loudly with them) using `BUNNY_API_KEY` + `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_ID` from **repository
secrets** — a failed deploy or missing marker fails the workflow loudly instead of purging blindly.
`scripts/bunny-url.mjs` holds the shared purge-URL normalization, also bundled into `/api/bunny-purge`.

The in-container entrypoint purge (`scripts/deploy/docker-entrypoint.sh`, serve + purge) is the
**opt-in last resort** for hosts without CI (`BUNNY_PURGE_ON_START=true` plus runtime-only Bunny
credentials on the app): it waits for the local readiness probe before purging and skips the purge when
readiness times out, so a broken container can't clear a healthy cache. Enable it ONLY when CI cannot
run; never alongside the CI workflow (one purge per deploy event).

Single-page purges between deploys go through the protected `/api/bunny-purge` endpoint
(`BUNNY_PURGE_SECRET` via Bearer/`x-bunny-purge-token`/`?token=`; paths normalized against `SITE_URL` in
`src/lib/bunny-purge.ts`; Bunny URL purges are rate-limited per account — trailing-slash URLs count as
prefix purges, ~30/min).

Bunny does not forward the visitor host, so `security.checkOrigin` is `false` in `astro.config.mjs` (see
the inline comment). `/api/contact` compensates with an endpoint-level browser CSRF guard — an `Origin`
allowlist (see `CONTACT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` below) — plus honeypot, streaming size cap, and per-IP rate
limit (keyed by the proxy-set `X-Real-IP`/`Client-IP` header or the proxy-appended tail of
`X-Forwarded-For` — never the client-controlled first value). Keep `Block Root Path Access`, `Block None
Referrer`, and `Block POST Requests` **off** on the zone (some zone types default them on, which 403s
first-time visitors and form submissions — and the pull zone's cache-error setting then caches those
403s). Dashboard steps: README "Bunny CDN".

Legacy WordPress URLs are handled host-neutrally by the `redirects` map in `astro.config.mjs` (served by
every adapter) and additionally by `public/_redirects`, which Netlify's CDN reads from the publish dir:
`/opt-out-preferences/*`, `/team-member-page-design/`, and `/author/*` 301 to their closest equivalents;
all other migrated WP URLs map 1:1 onto existing routes.

Analytics: GA4 loads via a single inline script at the end of `<body>` in `src/layouts/Base.astro`,
gated on `import.meta.env.PROD` **and** Netlify's `CONTEXT` being `production` (or unset) — which is why
the build scripts force `NODE_ENV=production` (see "Build and dev commands"). Deploy previews and branch
deploys (`CONTEXT=deploy-preview`/`branch-deploy`) and local dev are excluded. Measurement ID from
`PUBLIC_GA_ID` (default `G-ZREVRSHYJB`). The inline script starts the `dataLayer` queue immediately (so
the initial `page_view` and `<ClientRouter/>` re-fires are captured from page load), but gtag.js itself
is interaction/idle-gated: injected on the first `pointerdown`/`keydown`/`scroll`/`touchstart` or after
a 6 s idle fallback, because its bootstrap does forced-reflow layout queries (~150 ms in PSI traces)
that no script placement can avoid. `data-astro-rerun` keeps navigations sending pageviews; a
`window.__gaLoaderBound` guard (window survives ClientRouter swaps) prevents double-binding on reruns.

Environment variables (see `.env.example`). Shared rule for the secrets (`SIERRA_API_KEY`,
`BUNNY_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_ID`, `BUNNY_PURGE_SECRET`): never commit, never `PUBLIC_` prefix, and
on Coolify keep the Build Variable flag **off** (runtime-only).

- `SITE_URL` — production URL for sitemap/RSS/OpenGraph. Most platforms inject a fallback; **Cloudflare
  Workers does not — set it there**; set it on Coolify too (`COOLIFY_URL` is only a fallback).
- `PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID`, `TINA_TOKEN` — TinaCloud credentials, required for `pnpm build` everywhere
  (Netlify, Coolify Docker, local).
- `PUBLIC_GA_ID` — optional GA4 measurement ID override (default `G-ZREVRSHYJB`).
- `SIERRA_API_KEY` — Sierra lead-forwarding key for `/api/contact` (all platforms).
- `CONTACT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — optional comma-separated extra origins allowed to submit the contact form,
  besides `SITE_URL`, the platform URL envs, and the hardcoded brand/localhost origins
  (`https://thelippincottteam.com` ± `www`, the old `lippincottteam.com` ± `www` pair while that domain
  transitions over, `localhost:4321/4322`) — e.g. staging Bunny edge hostnames. Non-allowlisted `Origin`
  POSTs are rejected ("Cross-origin form submissions are not allowed.").
- `BUNNY_API_KEY` + `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_ID` — pull-zone purge credentials. Set them as **GitHub repository
  secrets** for the deploy-purge workflow; they should not live in the app environment except for the
  opt-in entrypoint purge. `BUNNY_ORIGIN_URL` (repo secret, recommended) is the direct origin the
  workflow polls for the deploy-commit marker; falls back to `SITE_URL`. Prefer the least-privilege
  pull-zone-scoped API key (Pull Zone → Security → API Key) over the account-level key; regenerate if it
  ever leaks.
- `BUNNY_PURGE_SECRET` — shared secret authorizing `/api/bunny-purge` (per-page purges between
  deploys). Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Optional (the endpoint answers 503 without it).
- `DEPLOY_ADAPTER` — optional adapter override.
